## **👻 How to Use**

1. Install a browser script manager (like [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo))
2. [Install the script](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/472190/%E5%AA%92%E9%AB%94%E9%9F%B3%E9%87%8F%E5%A2%9E%E5%BC%B7%E5%99%A8.user.js)
3. Visit any website with media content (some websites may not be supported)

## **🚧 Development Background**

I created this script because my PC motherboard is damaged, causing inconsistent audio levels.

Currently, the script only accesses basic media nodes and doesn't account for website-specific differences, so many sites may not be supported.

The adjustment menu is my own design - I apologize if it's not visually appealing as I don't have design skills.


## **⚠️ Important Notes**
- May be affected by other media-related scripts, potentially causing malfunction or settings changes
- When ineffective on certain websites, you may experience "no volume change | no sound | playback issues" - in these cases, disable the amplification

## **📜 Features Overview**
- When media is present on a page, the amplification node will be applied, allowing you to adjust sound amplification or completely mute it
- After configuring, if you choose to save, the settings will apply to all tabs with the same domain. For single-tab settings, you can click on any blank area to close the menu after adjustment

### **Enable/Disable**
- Enabled by default; once disabled for a domain, amplification will not be applied

### **Settings Menu**
- Can be opened through the script manager menu or by pressing (Alt + B)
