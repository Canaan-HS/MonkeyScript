# **Media Volume Booster**

---

## **👻 How to Use**

1. Install a browser script manager (like [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo))
2. [Install the script](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/472190/%E5%AA%92%E9%AB%94%E9%9F%B3%E9%87%8F%E5%A2%9E%E5%BC%B7%E5%99%A8.user.js)
3. Visit any website with media content (some websites may not be supported)

## **🚧 Development Background**

I created this script because my PC motherboard is damaged, causing inconsistent audio levels.

Currently, the script only accesses basic media nodes and doesn't account for website-specific differences, so many sites may not be supported.

The adjustment menu is my own design - I apologize if it's not visually appealing as I don't have design skills.


## **⚠️ Important Notes**
- May be affected by other media-related scripts, potentially causing malfunction or settings changes
- When ineffective on certain websites, you may experience "no volume change | no sound | playback issues" - in these cases, disable the amplification

## **👀 Menu Display**

## **📜 Features Overview**
- When media is present on a page, the amplification node will be applied, allowing you to adjust sound amplification or completely mute it
- After configuring, if you choose to save, the settings will apply to all tabs with the same domain. For single-tab settings, you can click on any blank area to close the menu after adjustment

### **Enable/Disable**
- Enabled by default; once disabled for a domain, amplification will not be applied

### **Settings Menu**
- Can be opened through the script manager menu or by pressing (Alt + B)

## 📣 Problem Feedback

> First of all, these scripts were originally written for my personal use and later simply shared with those who need them.
>
> As a developer providing scripts for free, I do not charge any fees and have no obligation to provide support for all situations, so I kindly ask you to maintain basic respect and friendliness when providing feedback.

#### ❓ Before submitting an issue, please note the following points:

**Not sure if it's a bug or a configuration issue?** Please use an "inquiry" approach to describe your situation, rather than directly determining that the script has an error.

#### 🔍 Description reference:

- **🖥️ Execution environment**: Browser, script manager (Tampermonkey, etc.), system platform
- **🧭 Operation process**: Detailed step-by-step explanation, not just a brief description
- **🎯 Expected result**: What effect you hoped to achieve and what actually happened
- **🤖 Suggestions (optional)**: If convenient, please try having an AI help understand your issue and attach the results

#### ⚠️ Important reminder:

**This is a free script, not a commercial product**

If your feedback lacks details, is emotional, non-constructive, or is just a simple sentence, I will not be able to or spend time guessing your meaning. Such feedback only consumes development enthusiasm and time.

#### 💡 Please understand:

**Developing, testing, and maintaining scripts requires a lot of effort**. Careless negative reviews can frustrate developers and even lead them to stop maintenance. Please cherish these free resources and report issues in a specific and rational manner.

**If you are unwilling to help clarify the issue and just want to vent and leave**, I suggest you choose not to use this script. Don't waste each other's time.

**If unclear and non-constructive comments appear in the future, I will choose to ignore them and may ultimately abandon script maintenance. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.**
