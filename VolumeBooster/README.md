## **🚧 Development Notes**

My personal computer's motherboard is damaged, leading to inconsistent audio levels. This script was written to address that issue.

Currently, it only grabs basic media nodes and does not account for differences between websites, so many websites may not be supported.

The adjustment menu was designed by me. If you find it unattractive, I can't help much as I don't have design skills.

## **⚠️ Usage Notes**
- It may be affected by other media-related scripts, which could cause malfunctions or changes in settings.
- If it doesn’t work on some websites, you may encounter messages like "Adjustment unchanged | No sound at all | Unable to play". In this case, disable the booster.

## **📜 Feature Overview**
- When media is present on the page, the script will apply the volume booster. After successful application, you can adjust the volume amplification or mute it completely.
- After setting, if you choose to save, the same domain in other tabs will also apply the settings. If you want it only for a specific tab, simply click on a blank area to close the menu.

### **Enable/Disable**
- By default, it is enabled. After disabling a domain, the booster will no longer be applied.

### **Settings Menu**
- You can open the menu via the script manager's menu or by pressing (Alt + B).
