## **‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes**
- It is recommended to wait until the page fully loads the original images before clicking the download button.
- If the page does not have a "Files" tab, no download button will be created.
- Sometimes, if the page loads too quickly, the MutationObserver may not have time to create the button, which could result in the button not being created.

## **üìú Feature Overview**

### **Download Button**
- A button is created next to the "Files" tab on the page. It may not be very noticeable, and that's intentional‚Äîit was designed that way.

### **Switch Download Mode**
- Compressed download
- Single image download (the new version of the plugin may have issues)

### **One-Click Post Open (Only for Post Preview Pages)**
- Enter a range to automatically open all posts on the current page.

### **Data Collection (Only for Post Preview Pages)**
- Collect data from the current page to the last page, retrieving relevant post data (currently, this works properly only on nekohouse in the release version; in the development version, it works on the other two sites).

## üì£ Problem Feedback

> First of all, these scripts were originally written for my personal use and later simply shared with those who need them.
>
> As a developer providing scripts for free, I do not charge any fees and have no obligation to provide support for all situations, so I kindly ask you to maintain basic respect and friendliness when providing feedback.

#### ‚ùì Before submitting an issue, please note the following points:

**Not sure if it's a bug or a configuration issue?** Please use an "inquiry" approach to describe your situation, rather than directly determining that the script has an error.

#### üîç Description reference:

- **üñ•Ô∏è Execution environment**: Browser, script manager (Tampermonkey, etc.), system platform
- **üß≠ Operation process**: Detailed step-by-step explanation, not just a brief description
- **üéØ Expected result**: What effect you hoped to achieve and what actually happened
- **ü§ñ Suggestions (optional)**: If convenient, please try having an AI help understand your issue and attach the results

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important reminder:

**This is a free script, not a commercial product**

If your feedback lacks details, is emotional, non-constructive, or is just a simple sentence, I will not be able to or spend time guessing your meaning. Such feedback only consumes development enthusiasm and time.

#### üí° Please understand:

**Developing, testing, and maintaining scripts requires a lot of effort**. Careless negative reviews can frustrate developers and even lead them to stop maintenance. Please cherish these free resources and report issues in a specific and rational manner.

**If you are unwilling to help clarify the issue and just want to vent and leave**, I suggest you choose not to use this script. Don't waste each other's time.

**If unclear and non-constructive comments appear in the future, I will choose to ignore them and may ultimately abandon script maintenance. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.**

## **üì¶ Version Information**

**Release Version: 0.0.21-Beta8** 

### **What's New**
Haven't had much time to work on this project recently. The current release version's "fetch post data" function doesn't support nekohouse yet.

1. Fixed bugs caused by recent website changes.

### **New Fetch Features (FetchSet)**

`AdvancedFetch`
If you don't need to fetch internal cloud or external links, you can set this to false. Reducing the Delay can make fetching basic data much faster.

`ToLinkTxt`
When enabled, it won't output complete data as JSON, but as a txt file. The data format is compatible with IDM import, so you can directly import into IDM to download all content. However, you need to confirm the text encoding to ensure IDM can parse it correctly, otherwise there will be garbled characters (default UTF-8).

### **Known Issues**
1. Newer versions of Tampermonkey have some issues with the GM_download API, causing the single image download function to error. It's recommended to only use compressed download.
