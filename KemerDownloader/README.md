## **‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Notes**
- It is recommended to wait until the page fully loads the original images before clicking the download button.
- If the page does not have a "Files" tab, no download button will be created.
- Sometimes, if the page loads too quickly, the MutationObserver may not have time to create the button, which could result in the button not being created.

## **üìú Feature Overview**

### **Download Button**
- A button is created next to the "Files" tab on the page. It may not be very noticeable, and that's intentional‚Äîit was designed that way.

### **Switch Download Mode**
- Compressed download
- Single image download (the new version of the plugin may have issues)

### **One-Click Post Open (Only for Post Preview Pages)**
- Enter a range to automatically open all posts on the current page.

### **Data Collection (Only for Post Preview Pages)**
- Collect data from the current page to the last page, retrieving relevant post data (currently, this works properly only on nekohouse in the release version; in the development version, it works on the other two sites).
