## **👀 Feature Demonstration**

- **0.0.20 Demo**: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOidYkgINY8)


## **📜 Feature Overview**

### **Automatic Login Detection**
- ❗️ Requires local Cookie setup to use
- When enabled, automatically checks login status every 10 minutes when entering the site and performs automatic login

### **Shared Account Login**
- Use the Cookies I personally provided to log in (2025-9-16 | 6) [Please notify me if they expire]
- Account expiration is due to website restrictions. Updates require time and effort, and I cannot monitor them constantly. If I receive numerous negative reviews due to expired accounts again, I will discontinue maintaining this script

### **Local Favorites**
- Add custom favorites in posts and view them on the favorites page (display only, site search function not supported)
- Display style follows the website's original style without additional adjustments; if other scripts modify the style, layout issues may occur
- Recommended to keep at least one native website favorite to avoid layout problems

### **Local Cookie Setup**
- Settings are shared between both sites
- Automatically acquired after login
- Manual input

### **Local Cookie Operations**
- View saved cookies (can be modified here)
- Manual injection
- Clear login (clears current login status, not the saved 🍪)

### **Language Auto-adaptation**
- **🌐 Supported Languages**: Automatically adapts to the following languages based on browser settings:
  - Traditional Chinese
  - Simplified Chinese
  - Japanese
  - English
  - Korean
  - Russian

## 📣 Problem Feedback

> First of all, these scripts were originally written for my personal use and later simply shared with those who need them.
>
> As a developer providing scripts for free, I do not charge any fees and have no obligation to provide support for all situations, so I kindly ask you to maintain basic respect and friendliness when providing feedback.

#### ❓ Before submitting an issue, please note the following points:

**Not sure if it's a bug or a configuration issue?** Please use an "inquiry" approach to describe your situation, rather than directly determining that the script has an error.

#### 🔍 Description reference:

- **🖥️ Execution environment**: Browser, script manager (Tampermonkey, etc.), system platform
- **🧭 Operation process**: Detailed step-by-step explanation, not just a brief description
- **🎯 Expected result**: What effect you hoped to achieve and what actually happened
- **🤖 Suggestions (optional)**: If convenient, please try having an AI help understand your issue and attach the results

#### ⚠️ Important reminder:

**This is a free script, not a commercial product**

If your feedback lacks details, is emotional, non-constructive, or is just a simple sentence, I will not be able to or spend time guessing your meaning. Such feedback only consumes development enthusiasm and time.

#### 💡 Please understand:

**Developing, testing, and maintaining scripts requires a lot of effort**. Careless negative reviews can frustrate developers and even lead them to stop maintenance. Please cherish these free resources and report issues in a specific and rational manner.

**If you are unwilling to help clarify the issue and just want to vent and leave**, I suggest you choose not to use this script. Don't waste each other's time.

**If unclear and non-constructive comments appear in the future, I will choose to ignore them and may ultimately abandon script maintenance. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.**
