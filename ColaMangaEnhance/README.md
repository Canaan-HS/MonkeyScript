## **üöß Development Notes**

Currently, there is no settings menu available. Customizations need to be done by modifying the code directly. Basic functionality has been implemented and uploaded. Plans to create a settings interface when time permits.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
- If other scripts modify the page elements, it may affect the proper functioning of some features.
- When ad-blocking plugins are enabled, it might cause layout issues or functional abnormalities. It is recommended to temporarily disable them if any issues occur.

## **üìú Feature Overview**

### **Simple Ad Removal**
- Automatically removes advertisement iframes on the page to enhance the visual comfort during reading.

### **Custom Background Color and Auto-Reload**
- Background color adjustments currently require modifying the code (future plans to add a settings menu).
- Automatically detects and clicks the "Reload" button to reduce manual operation.

### **Hotkey Controls (Desktop Only)**
- `‚Üê`: Previous page | `‚Üí`: Next page  
- `‚Üë`: Start auto-scrolling upwards | `‚Üì`: Start auto-scrolling downwards  
  - Press once to start, press again to stop in the same direction; press the opposite direction to switch scrolling direction.

### **Gesture Controls (Mobile Only)**
- **Swipe Right**: Previous page | **Swipe Left**: Next page  
  - You need to swipe about half the screen, keeping the swipe horizontal to avoid accidental touches.

### **Bottom Auto-Page Turning**
- **Regular Infinite Mode**: Implements infinite scrolling (occasionally has bugs, refreshing the page resolves it).
- **Optimized Infinite Mode**: Automatically clears read chapters to free up memory (occasionally has bugs, refreshing resolves it).
- **Other Modes**: Automatically jumps to the bottom when reached, offering "Fast | Normal | Slow" as options for trigger positions.
