## **🚧 Development Notes**

By hiding recommendations, you can avoid being constantly suggested by the algorithm and endlessly watching videos.

## **⚠️ Usage Notes**
- YouTube's loading method may sometimes cause the script to not fully reload, resulting in incomplete hiding or failure of quick hide functionality. Simply refresh the page to fix this.

## **📜 Feature Overview**

### **Hide End Recommendations**
- Some videos show recommended videos at the end. This script will automatically hide them, and hovering the mouse over the video area will restore them.

### **Quick Triggers (on watch page)**

| **Shortcut** |              **Description**              |
| :----------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|  `Alt + 1`   | Hide the right-side video recommendations |
|  `Alt + 2`   |         Hide the comment section          |
|  `Alt + 3`   |           Hide the options menu           |
|  `Alt + T`   |            Hide the title text            |
|  `Ctrl + Z`  |      Minimal view (hide everything)       |

## 📣 Problem Feedback

> First of all, these scripts were originally written for my personal use and later simply shared with those who need them.
>
> As a developer providing scripts for free, I do not charge any fees and have no obligation to provide support for all situations, so I kindly ask you to maintain basic respect and friendliness when providing feedback.

#### ❓ Before submitting an issue, please note the following points:

**Not sure if it's a bug or a configuration issue?** Please use an "inquiry" approach to describe your situation, rather than directly determining that the script has an error.

#### 🔍 Description reference:

- **🖥️ Execution environment**: Browser, script manager (Tampermonkey, etc.), system platform
- **🧭 Operation process**: Detailed step-by-step explanation, not just a brief description
- **🎯 Expected result**: What effect you hoped to achieve and what actually happened
- **🤖 Suggestions (optional)**: If convenient, please try having an AI help understand your issue and attach the results

#### ⚠️ Important reminder:

**This is a free script, not a commercial product**

If your feedback lacks details, is emotional, non-constructive, or is just a simple sentence, I will not be able to or spend time guessing your meaning. Such feedback only consumes development enthusiasm and time.

#### 💡 Please understand:

**Developing, testing, and maintaining scripts requires a lot of effort**. Careless negative reviews can frustrate developers and even lead them to stop maintenance. Please cherish these free resources and report issues in a specific and rational manner.

**If you are unwilling to help clarify the issue and just want to vent and leave**, I suggest you choose not to use this script. Don't waste each other's time.

**If unclear and non-constructive comments appear in the future, I will choose to ignore them and may ultimately abandon script maintenance. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.**
